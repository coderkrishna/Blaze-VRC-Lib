# Blaze-VRC-Lib
This repository will allow for having VRC Competition teams to understand what happens with VRC programming. This repo would have the ability for competing teams to get started with programming, and for experienced teams to develop advanced algorithms to compete 

# Samples
There will be various samples addressing the various levels of VRC experience.

## DemoProject
The first demo project is labeled demo project to be able to get the necessary ideas and understand the right concepts when it comes to the programming of the VEX EDR v5 brain.

## CompProject2
This is a sample competition template code, and it would be serving as the necessary template to be able to get things done.
